**`Junior Developer`**

I'm a self-taught back-end oriented developer trying to make my mark on the digital world one line at a time. What I lack in experience, I make up for with the ability to learn quickly and flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing coding environment.

  <summary><h3>👨🏻‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  <p>I started my journey as an Engineering student. I graduated, got my Bachelor's Degree, and started working. Over time, I realized I'm a very passion driven guy. I like to be involved in things I find interest in, and I've always found myself on my computer for hours troubleshooting, googling, discovering software etc..</p>
  <p>I have a lot of friends in the tech industry which opened my eyes to coding. I was pleasantly surprised to find out this field promoted learning, staying up-to-date with trends, and constantly evolving yourself by yourself without the need for any outside favours. This motivated me as I felt I have all the necessary tools to get started.</p>
  <p>I pursued a couple of programming certificates from Harvard for Web Development, joined that with hours of self-teaching online, and developed several educational/personal projects, so now, I find myself ready to take the next step into achieving my goal of working in a field I'm passionate about.</p>
